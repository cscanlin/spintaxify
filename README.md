# spintaxify

Based on stuff like:
http://www.spintaxtool.com/

Saw this done with regex and thought it looked fun to try using string slicing, itertools and recursion.

Note: I don't endorse (or really even believe in) this as an SEO tool.

Could be good for writing a bot or otherwise trying to imitate some natural language though
